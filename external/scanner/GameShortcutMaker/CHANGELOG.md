## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Empty and not-yet-extracted game folders now read as an actionable state
  instead of a bare error. A folder with no `.exe`/`.swf`/HTML launcher used to
  show the generic "No launcher found" message regardless of *why*. The scan now
  classifies it: an empty folder says so plainly, and a folder holding only a
  compressed archive (a `.zip`/`.rar`/`.7z`/… download that was never extracted)
  names the archive and tells the user to extract it here and re-scan. The item
  still stays in the Error state (nothing to apply), but the user knows what to
  do next (`scanner.classify_no_launcher`, `ui/workers.ScanWorker`).
- "Open selected folder" in the Confirm-launcher dialog now always works. It
  relied on a *highlighted* row, so it silently did nothing for a collection
  (no row is highlighted until one is picked), for the "No candidates found"
  placeholder, and for an empty/archive folder. It now opens a collection
  member's own folder, the highlighted launcher's folder, or — as a fallback —
  the game folder itself, so the button is never a no-op
  (`ui/dialogs.LauncherPickerDialog`).
- The Step 2 review right-click menu now acts on the row under the cursor.
  A right-click doesn't reliably move the table's current row, so the
  Open/Copy actions targeted a stale row — and when nothing was selected yet
  the menu didn't appear at all. It now resolves the row from the click position
  (`ui/main_window.MainWindow._open_context_menu`).

### Changed
- Synthesized shortcut icons are noticeably less pixelated. Small launcher icons
  were upscaled to a 256 px tile in a single bilinear step (and stretched to a
  square, ignoring aspect ratio), which looked soft and blocky. Upscaling now
  steps up by at most 2x at a time with smooth resampling and preserves the
  aspect ratio (centering a non-square icon on a transparent tile). The "fill the
  tile" threshold was also raised from 128 px to a full 256 px, so a 128/192 px
  embedded icon is rendered by this higher-quality path instead of being left for
  Explorer's low-quality scaler (`icon_extract`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- "Upscale small icons" option (on by default) on the scan page. It controls the
  shortcut-icon fix below: when on, a launcher whose best embedded icon is too
  small to fill a tile gets a synthesized upscaled 256px `.ico`; when off, the
  shortcut still points at the *largest* icon embedded in the launcher but no
  file is generated. Persisted in settings and applied both on Apply and on the
  new Refresh action (`ui/main_window`, `ui/workers.ApplyWorker`).
- "Refresh shortcut icons…" button (next to Flatten). Re-points the icons of the
  shortcuts already in the output folder to the best available icon — picking the
  largest embedded icon group and upscaling tiny ones when the option is on —
  without re-scanning the library. It walks the output folder (skipping the
  bookkeeping and backups folders), reads each `.lnk`'s target, and rewrites the
  link in place; broken/relocated targets are skipped, `.url` (HTML) shortcuts
  are left alone. Reports updated / skipped / failed counts
  (`ui/workers.RefreshIconsWorker`, `ui/main_window._refresh_icons`).

### Fixed
- Shortcuts no longer show a tiny icon centered in a big white tile. Windows
  pins a `.lnk` to icon index 0 of the target — the same default Explorer uses —
  which is sometimes a small frame (16/32/48 px) even when the launcher embeds a
  larger icon in a *later* group (e.g. a game whose 256 px icon sits behind a
  small `MAINICON`). Shortcut creation now scans every icon group in the target
  and points the link at the one with the largest native frame; ties keep the
  lower index so a game's authentic default icon still wins over an equally large
  launcher/repacker icon. When even the best embedded frame is too small to fill
  a large tile (< 128 px), a smooth-upscaled 256 px `.ico` is synthesized into
  `.game_shortcut_maker/icons/` and the link points there instead. All of this
  degrades to the previous `(target, 0)` behavior if icon extraction is
  unavailable, and existing shortcuts pick up the better icon the next time they
  are (re)applied (`icon_extract`, `shortcut_manager.create_or_replace_shortcut`,
  `storage.icon_cache_dir`, `ui/workers`).
- Launcher selection no longer targets an uninstaller/installer that sits *above*
  the real game. Candidates were taken from the shallowest folder depth holding
  *any* `.exe` — counting ignore-listed ones — so an Inno-Setup `unins000.exe` at
  a game's root pinned that depth and hid the real launcher one level down (e.g.
  `Undertale/Game-Data/UNDERTALE.exe`), leaving the uninstaller as the only
  candidate. Depth selection now skips ignore-listed executables: it picks the
  shallowest depth that holds a *usable* launcher and only falls back to the
  ignore-listed ones (as a last resort, so the entry is still actionable) when no
  usable `.exe` exists anywhere in the tree
  (`scanner.scan_game_folder_topmost_exes`, `collection._topmost_exes_for`).

### Added
- Browse for a launcher manually, for the exceptional entries the scan can't
  resolve. The Confirm-launcher dialog gains a "Browse for launcher…" button that
  adds any chosen file (.exe / .html / .swf / .bat / .jar / anything) to the top
  of the candidate list, pre-ticked and labelled "Browsed"; it stays visible
  regardless of the EXE/HTML toggle and its type is derived from the extension
  (HTML pages → `.url`, everything else → an exe-style `.lnk`). The Review table
  gets a matching right-click "Browse for launcher file…" action that re-resolves
  the row against the picked file (recomputing CREATE/REPLACE/SKIP, so even an
  "ERROR — no launcher found" row can be fixed) and remembers the choice so a
  re-scan keeps it. Duplicate picks (a browsed file that matches a scanned
  candidate) collapse to a single shortcut
  (`ui/dialogs.LauncherPickerDialog._browse_launcher`/`launcher_type_for_path`,
  `ui/main_window._browse_launcher_for_row`).
- Selectable Flatten interface: "Flatten folders…" now opens a checklist of every
  folder with redundant nesting instead of an all-or-nothing prompt. Each row is
  ticked by default and shows what will happen (levels collapsed, items moved);
  tick/untick individually or use Select all / none, double-click a row to open
  that folder, and the "Flatten N folder(s)" button tracks the live selection.
  So you can flatten a chosen subset rather than the whole library at once
  (`ui/dialogs.FlattenPickerDialog`, `ui/main_window._squash_folders`).

### Changed
- The output folder now holds only your shortcuts. All per-output bookkeeping —
  the shortcut index, undo log, confirmation cache, backed-up shortcuts, and apply
  error logs — moved out of the output root (where `.shortcut_index.json`,
  `.last_run.json`, `.confirmations.json` and `.backup_shortcuts/` used to sit
  beside the `.lnk`/`.url` files) into a single `.game_shortcut_maker/` folder
  inside it (backups live in `.game_shortcut_maker/backups/`). Existing folders
  are migrated automatically and transparently on the next *write* (a real apply,
  or saving a remembered launcher choice) — reads stay side-effect-free, so a Dry
  Run or a plain scan never moves anything and legacy data is read in place via a
  fallback until then. The move preserves the index, remembered picks, and undo
  history; undo logs that recorded the old backup locations still restore via a
  basename fallback. The collection subfolder mirroring, index keys, and the
  read-only-output resilience are unchanged
  (`storage.meta_dir`/`_migrate_legacy_meta`/`_meta_read_path`/`resolve_backup_path`,
  `ui/main_window._undo_last_run`).
- Professional visual refresh of the whole UI, with no change to the workflow.
  The stylesheet now derives every state from the active palette so all four
  themes get the same treatment: focus rings on inputs, a clear primary vs.
  secondary button hierarchy (one filled action per screen; everything else is an
  outline), themed checkboxes with a real check glyph, styled scrollbars, lists,
  combo popups, menus and tooltips, and consistent radii/spacing. Page and dialog
  headers are now palette-aware title/caption labels (the old inline-coloured
  rich-text headers were hard-coded to the dark palette and looked wrong on the
  light theme). The Review table hides row numbers, drops gridlines, and uses
  subtle alternating rows; the Setup/Confirm pages collect their actions into a
  bottom bar. Behaviour, widgets, and signals are unchanged
  (`ui/theme.build_stylesheet`/`make_header`/`_write_qss_icons`, `ui/main_window`,
  `ui/dialogs`).

### Fixed
- A Dry Run no longer creates anything in the output folder. It used to eagerly
  create the backups folder (now the consolidated `.game_shortcut_maker/`) even
  though a dry run writes nothing — the folder is now resolved lazily, only for a
  real apply (`ui/workers.ApplyWorker.run`).
- Collection hierarchy: a folder that merely *groups* already-detected
  collections (e.g. `Library/{PackA,PackB}`, each itself a collection) is now
  itself treated as a collection and mirrored as nested output subfolders
  (`Library/PackA/GameA.lnk`, …). Previously, because such a wrapper has fewer
  than the threshold *immediate* children, it was flattened into one ambiguous
  shortcut — silently discarding every game beneath it. A folder is now a
  collection when it has enough distinct game children **or** holds at least one
  nested collection (`collection._classify_from_index`).
- Flash (`.swf`) detection no longer loses to an ignore-listed `.exe`. A Flash
  folder that also held an uninstaller (e.g. `unins000.exe`) got a shortcut to
  the *uninstaller* instead of the `.swf`, even though the folder was correctly
  classified as a Flash game: candidate building used `non_ignored or all_best`,
  so an ignored-only `.exe` pre-empted the `.swf`/HTML fallbacks. The launcher
  order is now strictly **usable `.exe` → `.swf` → HTML → ignore-listed `.exe`
  (last resort)**, so a real launcher always wins and an installer-only folder is
  still surfaced for manual picking rather than silently shortcutting the
  uninstaller (`scanner.build_topmost_swf_candidates`,
  `ui/workers.ScanWorker._build_scan_item`/`_build_collection_item`).
- Shortcuts to games with non-ASCII paths (Japanese/Chinese names, symbols like
  `○ ♪ –`) now apply. The shortcut writer used WScript.Shell, whose late-bound
  `Targetpath` setter round-trips the path through the system ANSI code page and
  rejects with "Property '<unknown>.Targetpath' can not be set." any character
  outside it — so on a CJK system locale every such `.lnk` failed (166 of 329 in
  one library) while plain-text `.url` shortcuts still succeeded. Writing and
  reading now go through the Unicode `IShellLinkW` COM interface, which preserves
  the full path verbatim. This also fixes the reader, which previously replaced
  non-ANSI characters with `?` and so corrupted stale-target detection. The
  forward-slash normalization and over-MAX_PATH 8.3 short-path fallback are kept
  (`shortcut_manager.create_or_replace_shortcut`/`read_shortcut_target`,
  `_ensure_com_initialized`).
- Re-scanning after a Flatten no longer skips the moved games as "already exists".
  Flatten relocates a game's files, so its existing shortcut points at the old
  nested path; the scan now compares the recorded target against the launcher it
  would create and marks a relocated one as **Replace** (refresh) instead of
  Skip. Same-version games whose files never moved are still kept, and a
  lost/partial index never forces a needless replace
  (`shortcut_manager.target_moved`/`normalize_target_for_compare`,
  `ui/workers.ScanWorker._decide_existing`, `ui/main_window._recompute_item_decision`).

### Added
- Flatten redundant folders ("Flatten folders…" on the setup page): collapses
  pure single-child nesting in the game root — e.g. `Game/Game/v1.2/<files>` →
  `Game/<files>` — pulling the real content up into the top game folder (kept)
  and removing the empty wrappers. Only levels that hold *exactly* one subfolder
  and nothing else are collapsed, so nothing can be lost. It previews every
  planned move before touching disk, never overwrites, and is undoable (an undo
  log is written to the game root). Every move is within the same folder, hence
  an instant rename rather than a copy (`squash.py`, `storage.load_last_squash`/
  `save_last_squash`, `ui/workers.SquashWorker`, `ui/main_window.py`).
- Diagnosable apply errors: a run that fails many items now shows *why*. The
  completion dialog groups failures by category (e.g. "240 × Permission denied /
  read-only output folder", "5 × pywin32 not available") and the full per-item
  list is exported to a timestamped `apply_errors_*.log`. The log is written to
  a writable location — falling back to the per-user app config dir when the
  output folder itself is read-only, which is the very case that produces the
  errors (`shortcut_manager.categorize_apply_error`/`summarize_errors`,
  `storage.save_apply_error_log`, `ui/workers.py`, `ui/main_window.py`).
- Pre-flight output-folder check: before applying, the app verifies the output
  folder is actually writable and asks for confirmation if not, instead of
  silently failing every item (`storage.is_dir_writable`, `ui/main_window.py`).
- Multiple shortcuts per game: the launcher picker now uses checkboxes, so you
  can tick several executables for one folder and get one shortcut each. Extra
  shortcuts are named after the launcher's file stem (e.g. `Cool Game`,
  `Cool Game - editor`), de-duplicated automatically
  (`shortcut_manager.multi_shortcut_names`, `ui/dialogs.py`, `ui/main_window.py`).
- Confirmation caching: launcher choices are remembered per folder in a
  `.confirmations.json` beside the shortcut index, and reused on the next scan.
  The picker gains batch actions — *auto-create the rest with best/cached picks*,
  *skip the rest*, or *auto-apply cached and ask only for the rest* — so large
  libraries no longer need a click per game (`storage.py`, `ui/main_window.py`).
- Collection confirmation: a folder auto-detected as a collection is now
  confirmable in the picker via a *Treat as a collection* toggle. Leave it on to
  create one shortcut per sub-game (mirrored into subfolders); untick it to
  collapse the folder into a single game and pick launcher(s) from the combined
  executable list (`ui/dialogs.py`, `ui/main_window.py`).
- Recursive "collection of games" detection: a folder whose subfolders are
  themselves games is mirrored into an output subfolder of shortcuts instead of
  being collapsed into one ambiguous shortcut (`collection.py`).
- Flash (`.swf`) games are now detected. A `.swf` is treated as an
  exe-equivalent launcher — the shortcut is a `.lnk` straight to the Flash file
  (opened by the user's default `.swf` handler) — so a Flash-only folder gets a
  shortcut and a folder of Flash games is detected as a collection, instead of
  being reported as launcherless. A real `.exe` is still always preferred when
  both are present; the launcher order is now `.exe` → `.swf` → HTML entry point
  (`scanner.scan_swf_candidates`, `collection._has_direct_swf`, `ui/workers.py`).
  Flash launchers are labelled `SWF` in the review table (`ui/main_window.py`).
- HTML-only games are now detected during collection classification, so a
  folder whose only launcher is an entry point such as `index.html` is treated
  as a game (`collection.py`, `html_scoring.py`). In EXE mode, a folder with no
  `.exe`/`.swf` launcher still falls back to its best-matching HTML entry point
  (`ui/workers.py`).
- A pure-Python test suite (44 tests) covering classification, versioning,
  exe/HTML scoring, ignore rules, scanner traversal, and shortcut
  deduplication, plus a GitHub Actions workflow that runs it on Python 3.9 and
  3.12 (`tests/`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, `pytest.ini`).
- `IMPROVEMENTS.md`: a prioritized, code-grounded improvement roadmap.
- `docs/TUNING.md`: documentation of the collection threshold/depth knobs and
  the HTML launcher-score coupling.

### Fixed
- Long `.exe` targets no longer fail apply with the same opaque
  "Property '<unknown>.Targetpath' can not be set." Once forward slashes are
  normalized away (below), the other cause of that message is a target path at or
  beyond Windows' `MAX_PATH` (260 chars) — common for deeply nested doujin/RPG
  games under a long-named root. Such a target is now retried with its Windows
  8.3 short path (same file, short enough to be accepted); if it still fails, the
  error records the actual target and its length and is reported under the
  dedicated "Path too long" category instead of repeating the opaque message, so
  the apply log pinpoints the cause (`shortcut_manager.short_path`,
  `create_or_replace_shortcut`, `categorize_apply_error`).
- Creating `.lnk` shortcuts no longer fails with
  "Property '<unknown>.Targetpath' can not be set." when the game root or output
  folder was entered with forward slashes (e.g. `D:/Games/...`). Those slashes
  flowed straight into each `.exe` target via `os.path.join`, and WScript.Shell
  rejects forward slashes in its path properties — so an entire library failed
  to apply while only the `.url` (HTML) shortcuts succeeded. Paths are now
  normalized to Windows backslashes at the COM boundary
  (`shortcut_manager.to_windows_path`, used by `create_or_replace_shortcut` and
  `read_shortcut_target`). The error is also categorized explicitly now, so a
  recurrence shows as "Invalid shortcut target (Targetpath rejected)" instead of
  the generic "Other error" (`shortcut_manager.categorize_apply_error`).
- A read-only / encrypted output folder no longer fails an apply *after* the
  shortcuts were already created. The final `.shortcut_index.json` and
  `.last_run.json` writes (and the backup-folder creation) used to raise
  `PermissionError` outside the per-item guard, surfacing as "Apply failed"
  despite a successful run. Metadata persistence is now best-effort and reported
  as a non-fatal warning in the completion dialog (`storage.py`, `ui/workers.py`,
  `ui/main_window.py`).
- Scan progress no longer freezes at 0%. Collection detection used to walk the
  whole library before emitting any progress, so the bar sat at "Scanning…" 0%
  through the heaviest I/O. It is now an animated "Detecting collections…" busy
  phase (reporting folders scanned) followed by a determinate "Scanning games…
  i/n" bar (`ui/workers.py`, `ui/main_window.py`).
- Glob metacharacters in game names (commonly `[` / `]`, e.g. `Game [Final]`)
  no longer break duplicate-shortcut detection and cleanup. Both the output
  directory and the base name are passed through `glob.escape()` before building
  the lookup pattern (`shortcut_manager.py`).
- Directory traversal no longer silently drops a whole subtree when a single
  folder is unreadable (permissions, path too long). All `os.walk` calls now go
  through `safe_walk()`, which routes errors to a logging `onerror` handler
  instead of swallowing them (`scanner.py`, `collection.py`).

### Changed
- Split the 1700-line `app.py` into a `ui/` package (`theme`, `workers`,
  `dialogs`, `main_window`); `app.py` is now a thin `run_app()` entry point.
  Behavior is unchanged — the split is mechanical, and a few dead imports
  (`QIcon`, `ExeCandidate`, `shortcut_path`, `url_shortcut_path`) were dropped.
- Stopped tracking `__pycache__` build artifacts and added a `.gitignore`.
- Collection detection is now a single filesystem walk that feeds both
  classification and each game's executable list, eliminating the second
  per-game walk the scan used to do (the source of the post-1.0 slowdown). The
  walk stops descending below a folder's topmost non-ignored `.exe` — where the
  classifier already returns GAME — so a game's deep asset tree is never walked;
  HTML-only/ignored-only folders are still descended so a buried `.exe` is never
  missed. Net effect: scan speed matches (and for exe games beats) the original
  per-folder scan while keeping collection detection (`collection.py`,
  `scanner.py`, `ui/workers.py`).

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release: scan a game library, score candidate executables (and HTML
  entry points) per folder, and create/replace/skip Windows shortcuts with a
  review step, version-aware replacement, backups, and undo.
